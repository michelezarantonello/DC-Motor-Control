In this accademic course we did 4 project and in the end we had to do a report on one of them chosen randomly. In the pdf file there is the report for the third lab project. 
To get an idea read the introduction part of the pdf and in the end there are some snippet for the controllers matlab code and simulink models for the simulations. I added 
also the matlab code and simulink models for all the 4 projects, they are in the respective LAB folder. Here i upload also the video of the robot (that cant stand autonomously)
that we stabilize and move thanks to the controller we built.
