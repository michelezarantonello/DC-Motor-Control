This repository collects all the projects developed during the Control Engineering Laboratory (CELAB) course at the University of Padova.
The course focuses on applying control design techniques to real laboratory systems, from basic PID tuning to advanced state-space and optimal control. All controllers were designed and tested using MATLAB and Simulink, and later implemented on physical setups such as DC motors and a balancing robot.
Throughout the course, different control methods were explored and progressively improved. The experiments covered both theoretical design and real-world implementation, considering model uncertainties, noise, and actuator limits.
**LAB0**: design of a PID position controller for a DC motor using Bodeâ€™s frequency method. Static and viscous friction were estimated experimentally to refine the model for later use.
**LAB1**: the initial controller was enhanced with anti-windup protection and feedforward compensation for friction and inertia. The second part introduced state-space control with both nominal and robust tracking, applying the internal model principle to handle disturbances and time-varying references.
**LAB2**: dealt with digital control: a discrete-time position controller was designed both by emulation and directly in the discrete domain, highlighting the impact of sampling and discretization.
**LAB3**: dealt with a DC motor driving a flexible beam, modeled as a two-mass system. Here, both PID and state-space controllers were designed, including eigenvalue placement and frequency-shaped LQR methods for performance and robustness.
**LAB4**: focused on the longitudinal control of a two-wheeled balancing robot. A state-space controller was designed to stabilize the inherently unstable system and move it to a desired position, showing robustness against external disturbances. A video demonstration of the robot in action is also included (https://youtube.com/shorts/GmH9iNtEBmc?si=Ej6kAnR3sPeJH7Ax).
